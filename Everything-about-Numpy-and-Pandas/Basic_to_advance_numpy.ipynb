    "Numpy's main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In Numpy dimensions are called axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. the array for the coordinates of a point in 3D space, [1,2,1], has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The first axis (axis 0) corresponds to the outermost level of nesting or the rows in the array. It indeed contains 2 arrays, so its length is 2.\n",
    "The second axis (axis 1) corresponds to the innermost level or the elements within each row. Each row contains 3 elements, hence its length is 3.\n",
    "So,The first axis refers to the outer brackets (rows) and the second axis refers to the inner brackets (elements within each row)."
